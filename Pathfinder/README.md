Summary of scripts:

- pullStats.py: running this script prompts the user for the name of a 1e Pathfinder monster. If the name matches a monster from the beastiary it will provide the beastiary information for that monster. If there are multiple monsters under that entry it will present a list of those monsters. It can then open the relevent website if more information is needed. Future development would output the stat block of the monster for use in other programs. Currently, it save the stat-block to a text file.
